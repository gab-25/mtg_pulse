# TCG Pulse

Tracks the Cardmarket price of every single card of four games over time and shows it in Grafana:

| Game | Cardmarket game id |
|---|---|
| Magic: The Gathering | 1 |
| Pokémon | 6 |
| One Piece | 18 |
| Riftbound | 22 |

- **Daily sync** (`python -m tcg_pulse sync`): downloads each game's public price guide and singles list
  (trend, low, averages, normal and foil — Pokémon's "holo" is stored as foil) into a PostgreSQL +
  TimescaleDB hypertable, one row per card per day. History starts from the first sync: Cardmarket
  only publishes today's prices, so a day that is never imported is lost.
- **Rising cards**: after each game's import, every card priced ≥ 1 € is measured over 14, 28 and 56 days
  (gain, steadiness R², days with a price, rising quarters, largest single-day jump). The Rising
  dashboard applies the thresholds (defaults: ≥ 5 €, +15 %, no single-day spikes). Until the history
  is long enough, the **Cardmarket averages** window ranks the latest day alone: the trend against
  Cardmarket's own 30-day average, with the 1-, 7- and 30-day averages rising in order and gains over
  300 % left out. Its R² is that of the line through the four values (30, 7 and 1 day, trend): how
  evenly the rise is spread. It is noisier, since one sale can move those averages.
- **Expansion names** are derived from the names of Cardmarket's sealed products ("Origins Booster
  Box" → "Origins"). Wrong or missing names can be fixed by hand in
  [`tcg_pulse/expansion_overrides.json`](tcg_pulse/expansion_overrides.json) (`{"pokemon": {"6381": "Name"}}`);
  an expansion with no name shows its id, e.g. `#5229`.
- **Grafana** with two dashboards, provisioned from [`grafana/`](grafana/): **Rising** (pick the game,
  window, normal/foil, thresholds) and **Card detail** (search a card, price history). Login only.

## Running locally

```sh
cp .env.example .env          # set the passwords
docker compose up -d --build  # db, Grafana on http://localhost:3000, and one sync
docker compose run --rm sync  # sync again
```

Grafana reads the database as `grafana_reader`, a role that can only read. The sync's migrations create
it with `TCG_PULSE_DB_READER_PASSWORD` when it is missing — also on a database volume that already
exists — and let it read every table. Changing that password later is done by hand
(`ALTER ROLE grafana_reader PASSWORD '...'`). `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` only applies when the Grafana
volume is first created.

Rising's 14/28/56-day windows need a few weeks of history before they list anything; the Cardmarket
averages window works from the first sync.

## Database

The tables are SQLAlchemy models in [`tcg_pulse/models.py`](tcg_pulse/models.py); the schema is managed with
Alembic migrations in [`tcg_pulse/migrations`](tcg_pulse/migrations), which the sync applies on every run. After
changing a model, generate a migration and review it (TimescaleDB specifics, such as the `price`
hypertable, are written by hand in the migrations):

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tcg_pulse:tcg_pulse@localhost:5432/tcg_pulse uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Describe the change"
```

A test fails when the models and the migrations disagree.

Tests need a TimescaleDB database; each test works in its own throwaway schema, migrated with Alembic:

```sh
docker compose up -d db
uv run pytest               # TEST_DATABASE_URL defaults to the compose database
```

## Daily sync

`python -m tcg_pulse sync` is a one-shot command meant to run **once a day** from an external scheduler at
about **04:30 Europe/Rome**, after Cardmarket publishes the guides (~02:45).

- Each game is independent: one failing never stops the others.
- A game that fails — network error, or a guide still dated yesterday — is retried up to **4 attempts,
  15 minutes apart** (about 45 minutes at most).
- The command exits non-zero if any game is still missing, so the scheduler can report it.
- Idempotent: games fully imported today (prices, rising, names) are skipped, so a manual rerun only
  does what is missing.
- Every attempt is logged in the `import_run` table (shown on the Rising dashboard as "Last import").
- Every downloaded file is kept gzipped under `DATA_DIR/<game>/<date>/` (a few MB a day). To import an
  archived day again, replacing that day's prices (e.g. after fixing an import bug):
  `python -m tcg_pulse reimport --game pokemon --date 2026-11-01`.

## Production

- A new, empty PostgreSQL database with the TimescaleDB extension. The sync applies the Alembic
  migrations on every run.
- The migrations also create the read-only `grafana_reader` role, with `TCG_PULSE_DB_READER_PASSWORD`.
  Only if the sync's database user may not create roles (a managed database, or a deliberately
  restricted user), create it once by hand — `CREATE ROLE grafana_reader LOGIN PASSWORD '...';` — and
  the migrations just grant it read access.
- Run the image (`ghcr.io/<owner>/tcg-pulse`, default command `python -m tcg_pulse sync`) once a day with
  `DATABASE_URL` (and `TCG_PULSE_DB_READER_PASSWORD`, see above) set and a persistent volume on `/app/data`.
- Run Grafana with the files in `grafana/provisioning` mounted on `/etc/grafana/provisioning`, the
  dashboards in `grafana/dashboards` on `/var/lib/grafana/dashboards`, and the variables below.
  Disable anonymous access and sign-up as `docker-compose.yml` does; HTTPS is terminated by the reverse
  proxy in front of it.

## Configuration

| Variable | Used by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | sync | PostgreSQL URL; the database needs the TimescaleDB extension |
| `DATA_DIR` | sync | where downloaded files are archived (`/app/data` in the image) |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | compose | password of the `tcg_pulse` database user |
| `TCG_PULSE_DB_HOST`, `TCG_PULSE_DB_NAME` | Grafana | database host and name for the datasource |
| `TCG_PULSE_DB_SSLMODE` | Grafana | SSL mode of the datasource connection (default `disable`) |
| `TCG_PULSE_DB_READER_PASSWORD` | sync, Grafana | password of the `grafana_reader` role; the sync creates the role with it when missing |
| `GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER`, `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | compose | the Grafana login (`GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_*`) |
